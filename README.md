# AN-IT-TECHNICAL-SUPPORT-SYSTEM

## INTRODUCTION
An I.T technical support system is a system that monitors and maintains the computer systems and 
networks of an organization. It also provides technical assistance and support to employees. The I.T 
support system should be able to provide technical support to maintain the organization’s computer
systems, both hardware and software and other peripheral equipment to ensure optimal performance 
so that end users can maintain a high level of productivity. Technical support is being delivered using 
many different technologies. For example, questions can be answered using SMS, Telecalls, E-mail, Chat, 
Forums or Fax. Software issues can be resolved over the phone or using remote access. More complicated 
issues with hardware normally need to be dealt with the person. I was given the honor to create an I.T 
support system about a bank account management system. This is a website for maintaining a person's 
account in a bank. In this project I tried to show the working of a banking account system and cover the 
basic functionality of a Bank Account Management System. To develop a project for solving financial 
applications of a customer in banking environment in order to nurture the needs of an end banking user 
by providing various ways to perform banking tasks. Also, to enable the user’s workspace to have 
additional functionalities which are not provided under a conventional banking project.
The project analyzes the system requirements and then comes up with the requirements specifications. It 
studies other related systems and then come up with system specifications. The system is then designed 
in accordance with specifications to satisfy the requirements. The system design is then implemented with 
MYSQL, PHP and HTML. The system is designed as an interactive and content management system. The 
content management system deals with data entry, validation confirm and updating whiles the interactive 
system deals with system interaction with the administration and users

project is to provide secure and efficient net banking facilities to the banking customers over the
